So this folder contains the important results from the documentation research I did.

The python script parses parses the html representation of the current API documentation, as well as a C source or header file as specified as a command line argument. This was proof of concept of a system that would automate the insertion of the comments into the appropriate locations in source code. It wasn't entirely fleshed out but functions apparently very well.

The python script was designed for Python 2.7, on OSX. It requires BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing (available on pip), as well as clang. There can be issues with python finding clang, so beware. 

The doxyfile is the Doxygen configuration file that I used to generate the docs used in my presentation. It has a number of differences from the one autogenerated by doxygen. 

The doxystuff folder was used as a folder to place the custom theme and anything else I needed.
