#  Library Design

Library header files are located in the `/wolfmqtt` directory. Only the `/wolfmqtt/mqtt_client.h` header is required to be included:
```
#include <wolfmqtt/mqtt_client.h>
```

The library has three components:

### mqtt_client

This is where the top level application interfaces for the MQTT client reside.

* `int MqttClient_Init(MqttClient *client, MqttNet *net, MqttMsgCb msg_cb, byte *tx_buf, int tx_buf_len, byte *rx_buf, int rx_buf_len, int cmd_timeout_ms);`

These API's are blocking on `MqttNet.read` until error/timeout (`cmd_timeout_ms`):

* `int MqttClient_Connect(MqttClient *client, MqttConnect *connect);`
* `int MqttClient_Publish(MqttClient *client, MqttPublish *publish);`
* `int MqttClient_Subscribe(MqttClient *client, MqttSubscribe *subscribe);`
* `int MqttClient_Unsubscribe(MqttClient *client, MqttUnsubscribe *unsubscribe);`
* `int MqttClient_Ping(MqttClient *client);`
* `int MqttClient_Disconnect(MqttClient *client);`

This function blocks waiting for a new publish message to arrive for a maximum duration of `timeout_ms`.

* `int MqttClient_WaitMessage(MqttClient *client, MqttMessage *message, int timeout_ms);`

These are the network connect / disconnect interfaces that wrap the MqttNet callbacks and handle WolfSSL TLS:

* `int MqttClient_NetConnect(MqttClient *client, const char* host, word16 port, int timeout_ms, int use_tls, MqttTlsCb cb);`
* `int MqttClient_NetDisconnect(MqttClient *client);`

Helper functions:

* `const char* MqttClient_ReturnCodeToString(int return_code);`

###  mqtt_packet

This is where all the packet encoding/decoding is handled.

The header contains the MQTT Packet structures for:

* Connect: `MqttConnect`
* Publish / Message: `MqttPublish` / `MqttMessage` (they are the same)
* Subscribe: `MqttSubscribe`
* Unsubscribe: `MqttUnsubscribe`


###  mqtt_socket

This is where the transport socket optionally wraps TLS and uses the `MqttNet` callbacks for the platform specific network handling.

The header contains the MQTT Network structure `MqttNet` for network callback and context.

###  Example Design

The examples use a common examples/mqttnet.c to handle the network callbacks on the clients. This reference supports Linux (BSD sockets), FreeRTOS/LWIP, MQX RTCS, Harmony and Windows.
