#  Package Design

wolfJSSE is bundled together with the wolfSSL JNI wrapper in the
"**wolfssljni**" package. Since wolfJSSE depends on the underlying JNI bindings
for wolfSSL, it is compiled into the same native library file as the JNI
wrapper.

wolfJSSE / wolfSSL JNI package structure:

```
wolfssljni/
    build.xml  ant build script
    COPYING
    docs/      Javadocs
    examples/  Example apps
    IDE/       Example IDE project, Android Studio
    java.sh    Script to build native C JNI sources
    LICENSING
    Makefile
    lib/       Output directory for compiled library
    native/    Native C JNI binding source files
    platform/  Android AOSP build files
    README.md
    rpm/       rpm spec files
    src/
        java/  Java source files
        test/  Test source files
```

The **wolfJSSE** provider source code is located in the
`src/java/com/wolfssl/provider/jsse` directory, and is part of the
`**com.wolfssl.provider.jsse**` Java package.

The **wolfSSL JNI** wrapper is located in the `src/java/com/wolfssl` directory
and is part of the “ **com.wolfssl** ” Java package. Users of JSSE will not
need to use this package directly, as it will be consumed by the wolfJSSE
classes.

Once wolfSSL JNI and wolfJSSE have been compiled, there are two JAR files and
one native shared library that have been generated. These are located in the
`./lib` directory.

```
lib/
    libwolfSSL.so     (Native C JNI wrapper shared library)
    wolfssl.jar       (JAR with ONLY wolfSSL JNI Java classes)
    wolfssl-jsse.jar  (JAR with BOTH wolfSSL JNI and wolfJSSE classes)
```
